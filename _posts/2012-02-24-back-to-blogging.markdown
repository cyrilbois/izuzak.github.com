Forgive me, InterWebs, for it has been a year since my [last blog post](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html).
2011 was a very busy+wonderful year for me, and I've had the opportunity to meet many nice people, visit many cool places and work on many interesting projects.

* I gave [a talk](http://ivanzuzak.info/#talks) at the [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) of the [Open University, UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University) about inter-widget communication based on [the work](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4770) that [Marko](https://plus.google.com/105493585317824062514/) and I did in this field.
I've had the pleasure of meeting [Fridolin Wild](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/member/fridolin-wild), who organized the talk, and his research group at the KMI.
I also published [two papers](http://ivanzuzak.info/#talks) on inter-widget communication and the [pmrpc library](https://github.com/izuzak/pmrpc).
* I published [two papers](http://ivanzuzak.info/#talks) on the FSM-based formalism for modeling RESTful systems and presented one of the papers at the [ICWE conference](http://icwe2011.webengineering.org/) (held in Paphos, Cyprus).
I've also had the pleasure of meeting [Silvia Schreier](http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/dvt/en/team/silvia.schreier.shtml), discussing many REST-related ideas with her and starting work on [Feral](https://github.com/izuzak/feral) (a framework for developing RESTful systems).
* For the [Programming Language Translation course](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/plt) at the University of Zagreb (where I work as a teaching assistant), I've implemented an [assembler and simulator for a simple RISC processor, in pure JavaScript](http://ivanzuzak.info/FRISCjs/webapp/), which can be used in Web browsers and in NodeJS apps.
* I also played with [randomness analyses for two lotto systems in Croatia](http://ivanzuzak.info/cro_lotto_analysis/index.html), but since statistics isn't my strongest side, I'm quite far from interesting results.
Something similar to the [statistics for UK lotteries](http://www.lottery.co.uk/statistics/).
And yes, I do know that lotto really **is** random.
* Finally, I'm nearing the deadline for finishing my Ph.D.
I'm nearly done with my last seminar, and I'm working on my thesis and thinking about what the future will bring.
* [This Week In REST](http://thisweekinrest.wordpress.com/) is still alive and popular, but I update it less frequently due to lack of time.

So, over the next few months I'll (hopefully) be writing blog posts about some of these things, especially REST.
I've already updated a few of my [old](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html) [posts](http://ivanzuzak.info/2009/08/27/how-to-supercharge-your-free-appengine-quota.html) that continuously generate interest.
