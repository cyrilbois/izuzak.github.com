<a href="http://friendfeed.com/fftools"><img class="aligncenter" title="FFtools" src="http://friendfeed-media.com/p-ec49d82ba56b40f7a52b7fc838a84d44-large-1000" alt="" width="75" height="75" /></a><a href="http://friendfeed.com" target="_blank">FriendFeed</a> is the only social-networking application I <em>get</em> and like using, and one of the reasons why is that it's very community-oriented. The <em>groups </em>and <em>friends </em>approach of segmentation of attention easily directs both topic-oriented discussions and friends-oriented discussions towards the right people.

One other nice thing about FriendFeed is that, although not as popular as Twitter or Facebook, it has a healthy ecosystem of developers extending and building upon the platform.  Lots of great <a href="http://wittman.org/projects/friendfeedtranslate/install/index.html" target="_blank">user scripts</a>, <a href="http://ffcheck.com/" target="_blank">bookmarklets</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/feed-buster" target="_blank">feed-processing services</a>, <a href="http://ffsms.com/">sms services</a> and <a href="http://www.ffholic.com/" target="_blank">web apps</a> have been developed and recently even more so with the release of the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/api/documentation" target="_blank">new API</a>.

However, what I don't like about the ecosystem is the separation of developers which develop tools and their potential users. Developers mostly use the official <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/friendfeed-api" target="_blank">FriendFeed API Google group</a> and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/friendfeed-api" target="_blank">FriendFeed API group</a> for discussing programming issues and the API, while non-programmers mostly join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/friendfeed" target="_blank">FriendFeed Google group</a> and the <a href="http://friendfeed.com/friendfeed-feedback" target="_blank">FriendFeed Feedback</a> and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/friendfeed-beginners" target="_blank">FriendFeed for beginners</a> FF groups. This definitely isn't the best solution for the future of the ecosystem. There is no central hub for the exchange of ideas between users and developers - users have a hard time finding existing tools and suggesting new ones while developers are have a hard time finding out what users need.

Enter <a href="http://friendfeed.com/fftools" target="_blank"><strong>FF tools and services</strong></a> - a new FriendFeed group for both developers and users to discuss existing and future FF-related tools and services. The goals I hope the group will help catalyze are:
<ol>
	<li>establish a central place where <strong>both developers and users</strong> of FriendFeed tools can go to sync up and discuss ideas,</li>
	<li>compile a single <a href="http://friendfeed.com/fftools/119bf1b1/list-of-ff-tools-and-services" target="_blank"><strong>list of all FriendFeed tools and services</strong></a> - if you know or use a FF-related web app, bookmarklet or user script - just add it to this list and other users can use it to find cool apps,</li>
	<li>compile a single <a href="http://friendfeed.com/fftools/f5e50b9b/have-idea-for-cool-ff-web-app-or-service-add-your" target="_blank"><strong>list of suggestions for future FriendFeed tools and services</strong></a> - if you have an idea for a cool FF web app or service which doesn't yet exist - just add it to this list and a developer with some free time might build it.</li>
</ol>
And that's it - a place where the FriendFeed tools and services ecosystem can grow. <a href="http://twitter.com/izuzak" target="_blank">@izuzak</a>
